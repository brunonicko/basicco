Motivation
----------
While developing Python software for Visual Effects pipelines, I found myself having to
write the same boiler-plate code over and over again, as well as struggling with
compatibility issues and feature gaps between Python 2.7 and Python 3.7+.

So I decided to implement solutions for those issues at the `Base`_, literally.

Overview
--------
`Basicco` provides a `Base`_ class and multiple lower-level `Utilities`_ that enhance
code compatibility, readability, and validation.

Base
----
The `Base`_ class enables functionalities provided by `Basicco`.
It is designed to be a simple drop-in replacement for `object` when defining your base
classes:

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco import Base
    >>> class Asset(Base):  # inherit from Base instead of object
    ...     pass
    ...

frozen
^^^^^^
Class decorator that prevents changing the attribute values for classes and/or their
instances after they have been initialized.

Features are also available through the metaclass `basicco.frozen.FrozenMeta`.

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco import Base, frozen
    >>> @frozen(classes=True)
    ... class Asset(Base):
    ...     typename = "geometry"
    ...
    >>> Asset.typename = "nurbs"
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    AttributeError: class 'Asset' is frozen, can't set class attribute

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco import Base, frozen
    >>> @frozen(instances=True)
    ... class Asset(Base):
    ...     def __init__(self, name, typename):
    ...         self.name = name
    ...         self.typename = typename
    ...
    >>> asset = Asset("cube", "geometry")
    >>> asset.name = "sphere"
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    AttributeError: 'Asset' instance is frozen, can't set attribute

If you wish to freeze a class without freezing its subclasses or to freeze an instance
at any point in time, you can use the `freeze` function instead:

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco import Base, freeze
    >>> class Asset(Base):
    ...     typename = "geometry"
    ...
    >>> Asset.typename = "nurbs"  # this works, since the class is not frozen yet
    >>> freeze(Asset)  # will freeze the class (not its subclasses)
    >>> Asset.typename = "joint"
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    AttributeError: class 'Asset' is frozen, can't set class attribute

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco import Base, freeze
    >>> class Asset(Base):
    ...     def __init__(self, name, typename):
    ...         self.name = name
    ...         self.typename = typename
    ...
    >>> asset = Asset("cube", "geometry")
    >>> asset.name = "sphere"  # this works, since the instance is not frozen yet
    >>> freeze(asset)
    >>> asset.name = "cone"
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    AttributeError: 'Asset' instance is frozen, can't set attribute

final
^^^^^
Runtime-checked version of the
`typing.final <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.final>`_ decorator.

Can be used directly on methods but also on properties, classmethods, and staticmethods
(even in Python 2.7).

Features are also available through the metaclass `basicco.final.FinalMeta`.

This decorator is still recognized by Mypy static type checking, and it also prevents
subclassing and/or member overriding during runtime:

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco import Base, final
    >>> @final
    ... class Asset(Base):
    ...     pass
    ...
    >>> class SubAsset(Asset):
    ...     pass
    ...
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: can't subclass final class 'Asset'

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco import Base, final
    >>> class Asset(Base):
    ...     @final
    ...     def method(self):
    ...         pass
    ...
    >>> class SubAsset(Asset):
    ...     def method(self):
    ...         pass
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: can't override final member 'method'

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco import Base, final
    >>> class Asset(Base):
    ...     @property
    ...     @final
    ...     def prop(self):
    ...         pass
    ...
    >>> class SubAsset(Asset):
    ...     @property
    ...     def prop(self):
    ...         pass
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: can't override final member 'prop'

abstract
^^^^^^^^
Augmented version of the
`abc.abstractmethod <https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html#abc.abstractmethod>`_
decorator.

Features are also available through the metaclass `basicco.abstract.AbstractMeta`.

Can be used directly on methods but also on classes, properties, classmethods, and
staticmethods (even in Python 2.7).

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco import Base, abstract
    >>> class Asset(Base):
    ...     @abstract
    ...     def method(self):
    ...         pass
    ...
    ...     @property
    ...     @abstract
    ...     def prop(self):
    ...         return None
    ...
    >>> Asset()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Asset with abstract methods method, prop

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco import Base, abstract
    >>> @abstract
    ... class Asset(Base):
    ...     pass
    ...
    >>> Asset()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: can't instantiate abstract class 'Asset'

qualified
^^^^^^^^^
Support for qualified name falling back to AST parsing of the source code and/or class
definition hierarchy.

Features are also available through the metaclass `basicco.qualified.QualifiedMeta`.

Bases have a `__qualname__` attribute (even in Python 2.7):

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco import Base
    >>> class Asset(Base):
    ...     class Config(Base):
    ...         pass
    ...
    >>> Asset.Config.__qualname__
    'Asset.Config'

reducible
^^^^^^^^^
Support for pickling instances of classes that utilize qualified name and/or slots.

Features are also available through the metaclass `basicco.reducible.ReducibleMeta`.

Slotted and/or nested bases can be pickled (even in Python 2.7):

.. code:: python

    >>> import pickle
    >>> from basicco import Base
    >>> class Asset(Base):
    ...     class Config(Base):
    ...         __slots__ = ("name", "version")
    ...         def __init__(self):
    ...             self.name = "cube"
    ...             self.version = 2
    ...
    >>> pickled = pickle.dumps(Asset.Config())
    >>> pickle.loads(pickled)
    <__main__.Asset.Config object at...>

generic
^^^^^^^
Better support for the `typing.Generic` class (even in Python 2.7).

Features are also available through the metaclass `basicco.generic.GenericMeta`.

In Python 2.7 (without using `Basicco`) the example below would give you True due to a
bug in the `typing` module. The `Base`_ fixes that bug.

.. code:: python

    >>> from typing import Generic, TypeVar
    >>> from basicco import Base
    >>> T = TypeVar("T")
    >>> class Asset(Base, Generic[T]):
    ...     pass
    ...
    >>> Asset[int] != Asset[int,]
    False

explicit_hash
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Force `__hash__` to be declared when `__eq__` is declared (explicit is better than
implicit).

Features are also available through the metaclass
`basicco.explicit_hash.ExplicitHashMeta`.

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco import Base
    >>> class Asset(Base):
    ...     def __eq__(self, other):
    ...         pass
    ...
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: declared '__eq__' in 'Asset', but didn't declare '__hash__'

namespaced
^^^^^^^^^^
Dedicated/private (not shared with subclasses) `namespace`_ for storing data.

Features are also available through the metaclass `basicco.namespaced.NamespacedMeta`.

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco import Base
    >>> class Asset(Base):
    ...     pass
    ...
    >>> class SubAsset(Asset):
    ...     pass
    ...
    >>> Asset._namespace is not SubAsset._namespace
    True
    >>> Asset._namespace.typename = "Asset"
    >>> SubAsset._namespace.typename = "SubAsset"
    >>> Asset._namespace
    Namespace({'typename': 'Asset'})

Utilities
---------

caller_module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Retrieve the caller's module name.

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco.utils.caller_module import get_caller_module
    >>> def do_something():
    ...     caller_module = get_caller_module()
    ...     return "I was called by {}".format(caller_module)
    ...
    >>> do_something()
    'I was called by __main__'

custom_repr
^^^^^^^^^^^
Custom representation functions.

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco.utils.custom_repr import custom_mapping_repr
    >>> dct = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
    >>> custom_mapping_repr(
    ...     dct, prefix="<", suffix=">", template="{key}={value}", sorting=True
    ... )
    "<'a'=1, 'b'=2>"

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco.utils.custom_repr import custom_iterable_repr
    >>> tup = ("a", "b", "c", 1, 2, 3)
    >>> custom_iterable_repr(tup, prefix="<", suffix=">", value_repr=str)
    '<a, b, c, 1, 2, 3>'

dummy_context
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Dummy (no-op) context manager.

.. code:: python

    >>> from threading import RLock
    >>> from basicco.utils.dummy_context import dummy_context
    >>> lock = RLock()
    >>> def do_something(thread_safe=True):
    ...     with lock if thread_safe else dummy_context():
    ...         print("did something")
    ...
    >>> do_something(thread_safe=False)
    did something

wrapped_dict
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Read-only mapping that wraps a dictionary. If the wrapped dictionary mutates, that is
reflected on the the wrapped mapping too.

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco.utils.wrapped_dict import WrappedDict
    >>> internal = {"foo": "bar"}
    >>> dct = WrappedDict(internal)
    >>> dct["foo"]
    'bar'
    >>> internal["foo"] = "biz"
    >>> dct["foo"]
    'biz'

frozen_dict
^^^^^^^^^^^
Frozen dictionary implementation with methods that produce new copies instead of
mutating the original one. It doesn't wrap a dictionary, it always makes a copy.

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco.utils.frozen_dict import FrozenDict
    >>> dct1 = FrozenDict({"foo": "bar"})
    >>> dct2 = dct1.update({"a": "b"})

generic_meta
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Python 3 doesn't have a `typing.GenericMeta` metaclass, so
`basicco.utils.generic_meta.GenericMeta` will resolve to `type` on newer versions of
Python. For Python 2, it resolves to an improved version of the metaclass.

import_path
^^^^^^^^^^^
Generate import paths with support for qualified names and import from them.

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco.utils.import_path import get_import_path, import_from_path
    >>> class Asset(Base):
    ...     class Config(Base):
    ...         pass
    ...
    >>> get_import_path(Asset.Config)
    '__main__|Asset.Config'
    >>> import_from_path('__main__|Asset.Config')
    <class '__main__.Asset.Config'>

namespace
^^^^^^^^^
Wraps a dictionary/mapping and provides attribute-style access to it.

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco.utils.namespace import Namespace
    >>> ns = Namespace({"bar": "foo"})
    >>> ns.foo = "bar"
    >>> ns.foo
    'bar'
    >>> ns.bar
    'foo'

private_naming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Functions to privatize/deprivatize member names.

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco.utils.private_naming import privatize_name, deprivatize_name
    >>> privatize_name("Foo", "__member")
    '_Foo__member'
    >>> deprivatize_name("_Foo__member")
    ('__member', 'Foo')

qualified_name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Python 2.7 compatible way to find the qualified name inspired by
`wbolster/qualname <https://github.com/wbolster/qualname>`_.

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco.utils.qualified_name import get_qualified_name
    >>> class Asset(object):
    ...     class Config(object):
    ...         pass
    ...
    >>> get_qualified_name(Asset.Config)
    'Asset.Config'

recursive_repr
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Decorator that prevents recursion error for `__repr__` methods.

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco.utils.recursive_repr import recursive_repr

    >>> class MyClass(object):
    ...
    ...     @recursive_repr
    ...     def __repr__(self):
    ...         return "MyClass<" + repr(self) + ">"
    ...
    >>> my_obj = MyClass()
    >>> repr(my_obj)
    'MyClass<...>'

reducer
^^^^^^^
Python 2.7 compatible reducer method that works with qualified name and slots.

.. code:: python

    >>> import pickle
    >>> from basicco.utils.reducer import reducer
    >>> class Asset(object):
    ...     class Config(object):
    ...         __reduce__ = reducer  # reducer method
    ...         __slots__ = ("name", "version")
    ...         def __init__(self):
    ...             self.name = "cube"
    ...             self.version = 2
    ...
    >>> pickled = pickle.dumps(Asset.Config())
    >>> pickle.loads(pickled)
    <__main__.Asset.Config object at...>

state
^^^^^
Utility functions for managing an object's state.

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco.utils.state import get_state, update_state
    >>> class SlottedObject(object):
    ...     __slots__ = ("a", "b")
    ...     def __init__(self, a, b):
    ...         self.a = a
    ...         self.b = b
    ...
    >>> slotted_obj = SlottedObject(1, 2)
    >>> obj_state = get_state(slotted_obj)
    >>> obj_state["a"], obj_state["b"]
    (1, 2)
    >>> update_state(slotted_obj, {"a": 3, "b": 4})
    >>> obj_state = get_state(slotted_obj)
    >>> obj_state["a"], obj_state["b"]
    (3, 4)

type_checking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Runtime type checking with support for import paths.

.. code:: python

    >>> from itertools import chain
    >>> from basicco.utils.type_checking import is_instance

    >>> class SubChain(chain):
    ...     pass
    ...
    >>> is_instance(3, int)
    True
    >>> is_instance(3, (chain, int))
    True
    >>> is_instance(3, ())
    False
    >>> is_instance(SubChain(), "itertools|chain")
    True
    >>> is_instance(chain(), "itertools|chain", subtypes=False)

    ...
    >>> is_subclass(int, int)
    True
    >>> is_subclass(int, (chain, int))
    True
    >>> is_subclass(int, ())
    False
    >>> is_subclass(SubChain, "itertools|chain")
    True
    >>> is_subclass(chain, "itertools|chain", subtypes=False)
    True
    >>> is_subclass(SubChain, "itertools|chain", subtypes=False)
    False

.. code:: python

    >>> from itertools import chain
    >>> from basicco.utils.type_checking import assert_is_instance

    >>> class SubChain(chain):
    ...     pass
    ...
    >>> assert_is_instance(3, int)
    >>> assert_is_instance(3, (chain, int))
    >>> assert_is_instance(3, ())
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ValueError: no types were provided to perform assertion
    >>> assert_is_instance(3, "itertools|chain")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: got 'int' object, expected instance of 'chain' or any of its subclasses
    >>> assert_is_instance(chain(), "itertools|chain", subtypes=False)
    >>> assert_is_instance(SubChain(), "itertools|chain", subtypes=False)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: got 'SubChain' object, expected instance of 'chain' (instances of subclasses are not accepted)

.. code:: python

    >>> from itertools import chain
    >>> from basicco.utils.type_checking import assert_is_subclass

    >>> class SubChain(chain):
    ...     pass
    ...
    >>> assert_is_subclass(int, int)
    >>> assert_is_subclass(int, (chain, int))
    >>> assert_is_subclass(int, ())
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ValueError: no types were provided to perform assertion
    >>> assert_is_subclass(int, "itertools|chain")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: got 'int', expected class 'chain' or any of its subclasses
    >>> assert_is_subclass(chain, "itertools|chain", subtypes=False)
    >>> assert_is_subclass(SubChain, "itertools|chain", subtypes=False)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: got 'SubChain', expected class 'chain' (subclasses are not accepted)

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco.utils.type_checking import assert_is_subclass

    >>> assert_is_callable(int)
    >>> assert_is_callable(lambda: None)
    >>> assert_is_callable(3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: got non-callable 'int' object, expected a callable

unique_iterator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Iterator that yields unique values.

.. code:: python

    >>> from basicco.utils.unique_iterator import unique_iterator

    >>> list(unique_iterator([1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]))
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

weak_reference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Weak reference-like object that supports pickling.

.. code:: python

    >>> import pickle
    >>> from basicco.utils.weak_reference import WeakReference
    >>> class MyClass(object):
    ...     pass
    ...
    >>> strong = MyClass()
    >>> weak = WeakReference(strong)
    >>> pickle.loads(pickle.dumps((strong, weak)))
    (<__main__.MyClass object at...>, <WeakReference object at...; to 'MyClass' at...>)

There's also a unique hash weak reference-like class that has a hash based on itself
(and not on the object being referenced):

.. code:: python

    >>> import pickle
    >>> from basicco.utils.weak_reference import UniqueHashWeakReference
    >>> class MyClass(object):
    ...     __hash__ = None
    ...
    >>> strong = MyClass()
    >>> weak = UniqueHashWeakReference(strong)
    >>> hash(weak) == object.__hash__(weak)
    True
